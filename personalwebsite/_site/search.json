    "text": "(Airport 2024)\nIn this analysis, I explored what factors characterize delayed flights out of BWI airport in 2015. Which airline carriers were most likely to have delayed flights? Were flights more likely to be delayed during certain months? Were there any associations between flight time and length of delay? This analysis intended for air travelers in the U.S., frequent or infrequent, sheds some light on the previous questions using U.S. domestic flight data from 2015. This dataset is from Kaggle (Transportation 2016) and was originally produced by the Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The original dataset has 5.8 million observations, each one a different flight, and 31 columns with information about the flight including date of flight, carrier, flight status, and reason for possible delay, diversion, or cancellation. To narrow down the data analysis, I filtered the data to only include flights departing from BWI so I can focus the analysis on flight status out of BWI airport. There were 86,079 flight observations out of BWI in 2015. The data source also includes two small tables with airport and airline abbreviations used in the dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe original dataset is very large so I did not upload it to the GitHub repository. Instead, I filtered the dataset by flights outgoing from BWI only and uploaded that subset to my GitHub repository for this website (called flights_bwi.csv).

The information from Figure 2 may provide insight to better understand Figure 1. For example, is possible that since BWI is a Southwest hub, this influences the destinations it flies to which could have implications on delays that differ from the other airlines.\n\ndelay_by_airline %&gt;% \n  group_by(MONTH) %&gt;% \n  mutate(MONTH = as.factor(MONTH)) %&gt;% \n  summarize(proportion_delayed = sum(delay_status)/length(MONTH)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = MONTH, y = proportion_delayed, group = 1)) +\n  geom_path(linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"green4\") +\n  geom_point(color = \"green4\") + \n  ggtitle (\"Proportion of Flights out of BWI Delayed by Month\") + \n  ylab(\"Proportion Delayed\") + xlab(\"Month\") +\n  theme(title = element_text(family = \"Optima\"), legend.text = element_text(family = \"Optima\"), axis.text.x = element_text(family = \"Optima\"), axis.text.y = element_text(family = \"Optima\")) + labs(subtitle = \"June and July saw the highest rates of delays out BWI in 2015\", caption = \"Figure 3: Delay rates by month\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis line graph shows the trends in delays throughout the year. The highest rate of delay occurred during the summer in June and July (perhaps due to an increase in summer traveling or vacations), while the lowest rates were in April and November. Moderate delay rate occurred from December to March, which was perhaps due to more severe weather events such as snow during the Winter months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThis dataset does not include any observations on flights out of BWI during October 2015 and there is no documentation about this from the data source.\n\n\nTo further explore that hypothesis, I made a plot showing the proportion of delays each month that were due specifically to weather.\n\ndelay_by_airline %&gt;% \n  filter(delay_status == 1) %&gt;% \n  mutate(weather_delay_status = case_when(\n    WEATHER_DELAY &lt; 15 ~ 0,\n    WEATHER_DELAY &gt;= 15 ~ 1,\n    is.na(WEATHER_DELAY) ~ 0\n  )) %&gt;% \n  group_by(MONTH) %&gt;% \n  mutate(MONTH = as.factor(MONTH)) %&gt;% \n  summarize(proportion_delayed = sum(weather_delay_status)/length(MONTH)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = MONTH, y = proportion_delayed, group = 1)) +\n  geom_path(linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"green4\") +\n  geom_point(color = \"green4\") + \n  ggtitle (\"Proportion of Delayed Flights due to Weather out of BWI by Month\") + \n  ylab(\"Proportion Delayed\") + xlab(\"Month\") +\n  theme(title = element_text(family = \"Optima\"), legend.text = element_text(family = \"Optima\"), axis.text.x = element_text(family = \"Optima\"), axis.text.y = element_text(family = \"Optima\")) + labs(subtitle = \"June had the highest proportion of delays due to weather out of any month\", caption = \"Figure 4: Delay rates due to weather by month\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, this graph shows that the month with the highest proportion delays being weather delays is June, so it seems that the delays in the Winter months may be due to a different cause.\nLastly, I explored potential relationship between length or delay and length of outgoing flight. To do so, I split up the delayed flights into 4 categories: a short delay of 15-30 minutes, a short-moderate delay of 30 minutes to 1 hour, a moderate delay of 1 to 2 hours, and a long delay of 2+ hours. Faceting by these categories, I made a histograms to show the distribution of flight time.\n\nsuppressWarnings(delay_by_airline %&gt;% \n  filter(delay_status == \"1\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(delay_category = case_when(\n    DEPARTURE_DELAY &gt; 15 & DEPARTURE_DELAY &lt; 30 ~ \"Short\",\n    DEPARTURE_DELAY &gt;= 30 & DEPARTURE_DELAY &lt; 60 ~ \"Short/Moderate\",\n    DEPARTURE_DELAY &gt;= 60 & DEPARTURE_DELAY &lt; 120 ~ \"Moderate\",\n    DEPARTURE_DELAY &gt;= 120 ~ \"Long\"\n  )) %&gt;% \n  mutate(delay_category = factor(delay_category, levels = c(\"Short\", \"Short/Moderate\", \"Moderate\", \"Long\"))) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = AIR_TIME, group = delay_category)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y= after_stat(width*density)), fill = \"green4\", bins = 35) +\n  facet_wrap(~delay_category) + xlab(\"Air Time (Minutes)\") + \n  ylab(\"Density\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Flight Time Categorized by Length of Delay\") + \n  theme(title = element_text(family = \"Optima\"), legend.text = element_text(family = \"Optima\"), axis.text.x = element_text(family = \"Optima\"), axis.text.y = element_text(family = \"Optima\"), strip.text.x = element_text(family = \"Optima\")) + labs(subtitle = str_wrap(\"Delayed flights with shorter delays had higher density of shorter flight times Short = 15-30 min delay, Short/Moderate = 30 min-1 hour delay,      Moderate = 1-2 hour delay, Long = 2+ hour delay\", width = 80), caption = \"Figure 5: Distribution of flight time by length of delay\"))\n\nWarning: Removed 127 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis faceted plot shows that the distributions of flight time for the shorter delays are slightly more right skewed compared to the longer delays. This suggests that flights with shorter delays are more likely to be shorter flights. Perhaps a more informative way to explore this trend would be to reverse the conditional probability and look at the distribution of delay time based on flight time. However, making visual aids for this type of analysis is difficult because there are some observations with extremely high delay times that make constructing histograms difficult and/or not very informative. For this reason, splitting up delay times into categories as I did here helps account for that.\n\n\nSummary\nOverall, there are definitely factors that influence delayed flights out of BWI. There are clearly trends in which airlines have more delays than others, with Southwest and Spirit being the airlines with the highest rates of delay out BWI. There is also a temporal relationship, and travelers should be prepared for a higher chance of flight delay in June and July compared to other times of year. There also seems to be an association between length of delay and length of flight, of the flights that were delayed. Among delayed flights, it seems that shorter delays were associated with shorter flights. For future analysis, it would be useful to further investigate why this dataset does not include data on October of 2015. It would also be useful to investigate the other causes of delay besides weather delay that were included in the dataset.\n\n\nFunctions Used\ndplyr:\nfilter()\nmutate()\ngroup_by()\nsummarize()\narrange()\nn()\ncase_when()\n\nggplot: ggplot()\ngeom_bar()\ngeom_path()\ngeom_point()\ngeom_histogram()\nfacet_wrap()\ntheme()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAdministration, Federal Aviation. n.d.
