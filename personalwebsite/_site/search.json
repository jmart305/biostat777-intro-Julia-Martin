I graduated from UCLA in June 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Data Science and a Minor in Public Health. While studying at UCLA, I was a student researcher at the UCLA Department of Medicine Statistics Core, in which I assisted a senior statistician in data analysis on patterns in childhood trauma using R. My current interests include using EHR data to make predictions about patient outcome and improve medical practice."

    "text": "Flight Delay Prediction\nWhich airline carriers are most likely to have delayed flights? Which times This analysis intended for air travelers in the U.S., frequent or infrequent, sheds some light on the previous questions using U.S. domestic flight data from 2015. This dataset is from Kaggle and was originally produced by the Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The original dataset has 5.8 million observations, each one a different flight, and 31 columns with information about the flight including date of flight, carrier, flight status, and reason for possible delay, diversion, or cancellation. To narrow down the data analysis, I filtered the data to only include flights departing from BWI so I can focus the analysis on flight status out of BWI airport. There are 86,079 flight observations out of BWI in 2015.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n\nflights &lt;- read.csv(\"flights.csv\") # Read in data\n\nflights.bwi &lt;- flights %&gt;% # Filter by only flights originating from Baltimore\n  filter(ORIGIN_AIRPORT == \"BWI\")\nwrite.csv(flights.bwi, \"flights_bwi.csv\")\n\n\nflights_bwi &lt;- read.csv(\"flights_bwi.csv\") # Reread in smaller dataset\nairports &lt;- read.csv(\"airports.csv\") # Read in airport and airline data\nairlines &lt;- read.csv(\"airlines.csv\")\n\n\n\nData Dictionary\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIATA_CODE\nAIRLINE\n\n\n\n\nUA\nUnited Air Lines Inc.\n\n\nAA\nAmerican Airlines Inc.\n\n\nUS\nUS Airways Inc.\n\n\nF9\nFrontier Airlines Inc.\n\n\nB6\nJetBlue Airways\n\n\nOO\nSkywest Airlines Inc.\n\n\nAS\nAlaska Airlines Inc.\n\n\nNK\nSpirit Air Lines\n\n\nWN\nSouthwest Airlines Co.\n\n\nDL\nDelta Air Lines Inc.\n\n\nEV\nAtlantic Southeast Airlines\n\n\nHA\nHawaiian Airlines Inc.\n\n\nMQ\nAmerican Eagle Airlines Inc.\n\n\nVX\nVirgin America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nYear\nYear of the Flight Trip\n\n\nMonth\nMonth of the Flight Trip\n\n\nDay\nDay of the Flight Trip\n\n\nDay_of_Week\nDay of week of the Flight Trip\n\n\nAirline\nAirline Identifier (See table below for list of airline codes)\n\n\nFlight_Number\nFlight Identifier\n\n\nTail_Number\nAircraft Identifier\n\n\nOrigin_Airport\nStarting Airport (All BWI for this analysis)\n\n\nDestination_Airport\nDestination Airport (See list of airport codes here)\n\n\nScheduled_Departure\nPlanned Departure Time\n\n\nDeparture_Time\nWheel_Off - Taxi_Out\n\n\nDeparture_Delay\nTotal Delay on Departure\n\n\nTaxi_Out\nThe time duration elapsed between departure from the origin airport gate and wheels off\n\n\nWheels_Off\nThe time point that the aircraft’s wheels leave the ground\n\n\nScheduled_Time\nPlanned time amount needed for the flight trip\n\n\nElapsed_Time\nAir_Time +Taxi_In + Taxi_Out\n\n\nAir_Time\nThe time duration between wheels_off and wheels_on time\n\n\nDistance\nDistance between two airports\n\n\nWheels_On\nThe time point that the aircraft’s wheels touch on the ground\n\n\nTaxi_In\nThe time duration elapsed between wheels-on and gate arrival at the destination airport\n\n\nScheduled_Arrival\nPlanned arrival time\n\n\nArrival_Time\nWheels_On + Taxi_In\n\n\nArrival_Delay\nArrival_Time - Scheduled_Arrival\n\n\nDiverted\nAircraft landed on airport that out of schedule\n\n\nCancelled\nFlight Cancelled (1 = cancelled)\n\n\nCancellation_Reason\nReason for Cancellation of flight: A - Airline/Carrier;
