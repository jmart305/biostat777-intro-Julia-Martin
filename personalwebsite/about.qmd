title: "About Me"
---

I am a first year Biostatistics ScM student at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. I graduated from UCLA in June 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Data Science and a Minor in Public Health. While studying at UCLA, I was a student researcher at the UCLA Department of Medicine Statistics Core, in which I assisted a senior statistician in data analysis on patterns in childhood trauma using R. My current interests include using EHR data to make predictions about patient outcome and improve medical practice.
