title: "Example Analysis - Flight Delays at BWI"
---

![](OG-RouteMap.webp){width="693"}

In this analysis, I explore what factors characterize delayed flights out of BWI airport. Which airline carriers are most likely to have delayed flights? Are flights more likely to be delayed during certain months? Are there certain airport destinations that have a higher rate of delays from Baltimore compared to other destinations? This analysis intended for air travelers in the U.S., frequent or infrequent, sheds some light on the previous questions using U.S. domestic flight data from 2015. This dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?select=flights.csv) and was originally produced by the Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The original dataset has 5.8 million observations, each one a different flight, and 31 columns with information about the flight including date of flight, carrier, flight status, and reason for possible delay, diversion, or cancellation. To narrow down the data analysis, I filtered the data to only include flights departing from BWI so I can focus the analysis on flight status out of BWI airport. There were 86,079 flight observations out of BWI in 2015.

Which airline carriers are most likely to have delayed flights? Are flights more likely to be delayed during certain months? Are there certain airport destinations that have a higher rate of delays from Baltimore compared to other destinations?

# Analysis

```{r}
flights_bwi %>% 
  filter(DEPARTURE_DELAY > 0) %>% 
  nrow / nrow(flights_bwi)

delayed <- flights_bwi %>% 
  filter(DEPARTURE_DELAY > 15) 
nrow(delayed) / nrow(flights_bwi)
```

48.6% of flights out of BWI in 2015 were delayed. However, the Federal Aviation Administration defines a delay as a flight that leaves 15 or more minutes late. Using this definition, 23.3% of flights out of BWI were delayed. https://aspm.faa.gov/aspmhelp/index/Types_of_Delay.html

```{r}
delay_by_airline <- flights_bwi %>% 
  mutate(delay_status = ifelse(DEPARTURE_DELAY > 15, 1, 0)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(delay_status)) 

summarized_delays <- delay_by_airline %>% 
  group_by(AIRLINE) %>% 
  summarize(num_delayed_flights = sum(delay_status,na.rm = T), total_flights = n(), proportion_of_flights_delayed = sum(delay_status, na.rm = T)/n()) %>% 
  arrange(-proportion_of_flights_delayed)
summarized_delays
```

This table sorts the airlines by proportion of flights delayed from most to least.

::: callout-note
Skywest only has one observation in this dataset and it was a delay, so I will remove it from analysis on which airlines have the highest rate of delay since it skews the results.
:::

```{r}
delay_by_airline <- delay_by_airline %>% 
  filter(AIRLINE != "OO") %>% 
  mutate(AIRLINE = reorder(AIRLINE, -delay_status))

ggplot(delay_by_airline, aes(fill = as.factor(delay_status), y = length(delay_status), x = AIRLINE)) + 
  geom_bar(position="fill", stat="identity") + ggtitle("Proportion of Flights Delayed out of BWI by Airline") + 
  xlab("Airline") + 
  ylab("Proportion of Flights Delayed") + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Delay Status")) + 
scale_fill_manual(labels = c("No", "Yes"), values = c("green4", "orange2")) + 
  theme(title = element_text(family = "Optima"), legend.text = element_text(family = "Optima"), axis.text.x = element_text(family = "Optima"), axis.text.y = element_text(family = "Optima")) + 
  labs(subtitle = str_wrap("Spirit Airlines and Southwest Airlines have the highest proportion of delayed flights while US Airways has the lowest"), caption = "Figure 1: Airlines ranked by delay status")
```

```{r}
summarized_delays %>% 
  filter(AIRLINE != "OO") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(AIRLINE,-total_flights),y = total_flights)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "green4") + ylab("Total Number of Flights") + xlab("Airline") + ggtitle("Frequency of Flights out of BWI by Airline") +
  theme(title = element_text(family = "Optima"), legend.text = element_text(family = "Optima"), axis.text.x = element_text(family = "Optima"), axis.text.y = element_text(family = "Optima")) + labs(subtitle = "Southwest operated far more flights out of BWI in 2015 compared to other airlines", caption = "Figure 2: Airlines ranked by number of total flights")
```

Comparing Figure 1 and Figure 2, we see that Southwest Airlines has both a high proportion of delayed flights but also a large number of flights operating out of BWI. The information from Figure 2 may provide insight to better understand Figure 1. For example, is possible that since BWI is a Southwest hub, this influences the destinations it flies to which could have implications on delays that differ from the other airlines.

Next, I examined the severity of delays to see if there are any patterns across airlines. I sorted the delayed flights into 4 categories: a short delay of 15-30 minutes, a short-moderate delay of 30 minutes to 1 hour, a moderate delay of 1 to 2 hours, and a long delay of 2+ hours. Faceting by these categories, I made a plot to show the proportion

```{r}
delay_by_airline %>% 
  filter(delay_status == "1") %>% 
  mutate(delay_category = case_when(
    DEPARTURE_DELAY > 15 & DEPARTURE_DELAY < 30 ~ "short",
    DEPARTURE_DELAY >= 30 & DEPARTURE_DELAY < 60 ~ "short/moderate",
    DEPARTURE_DELAY >= 60 & DEPARTURE_DELAY < 120 ~ "moderate",
    DEPARTURE_DELAY >= 120 ~ "long"
  )) 


delay_by_airline %>% 
  group_by(MONTH) %>% 
  mutate(MONTH = as.factor(MONTH)) %>% 
  summarize(proportion_delayed = sum(delay_status)/length(MONTH)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = MONTH, y = proportion_delayed, group = 1)) +
  geom_path(linetype = "dashed", color = "green4") +
  geom_point(color = "green4") + 
  ggtitle ("Proportion of Flights out of BWI Delayed by Month") + 
  ylab("Proportion Delayed") + xlab("Month") +
  theme(title = element_text(family = "Optima"), legend.text = element_text(family = "Optima"), axis.text.x = element_text(family = "Optima"), axis.text.y = element_text(family = "Optima")) + labs(subtitle = "June and July saw the highest rates of delays out BWI in 2015", caption = "Figure 3: Delay rates by month")
```

This line graph shows the trends in delays throughout the year. The highest rate of delay occurred during the summer in June and July (perhaps due to an increase in summer traveling or vacations), while the lowest rates were in April and November. Moderate delay rate occurred from December to March, which was perhaps due to more severe weather events such as snow during the Winter months.

::: callout-caution
This dataset does not include any observations on flights out of BWI during October 2015 and there is no documentation about this from the data source.
:::

To further explore that hypothesis, I made a plot showing the proportion of delays each month that were due specifically to weather. 

```{r}
delay_by_airline %>% 
  filter(delay_status == 1) %>% 
  mutate(weather_delay_status = case_when(
    WEATHER_DELAY < 15 ~ 0,
    WEATHER_DELAY >= 15 ~ 1,
    is.na(WEATHER_DELAY) ~ 0
  )) %>% 
  group_by(MONTH) %>% 
  mutate(MONTH = as.factor(MONTH)) %>% 
  summarize(proportion_delayed = sum(weather_delay_status)/length(MONTH)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = MONTH, y = proportion_delayed, group = 1)) +
  geom_path(linetype = "dashed", color = "green4") +
  geom_point(color = "green4") + 
  ggtitle ("Proportion of Flights out of BWI Delayed by Month") + 
  ylab("Proportion Delayed") + xlab("Month") +
  theme(title = element_text(family = "Optima"), legend.text = element_text(family = "Optima"), axis.text.x = element_text(family = "Optima"), axis.text.y = element_text(family = "Optima")) + labs(subtitle = "June and July saw the highest rates of delays out BWI in 2015", caption = "Figure 3: Delay rates by month")
```

Interestingly, this graph shows that the month with the highest proportion delays being weather delays is June, so it seems that the delays in the Winter months may be due to a different cause. 



```{r}
delay_by_airline %>% 
  mutate(delay_reason = case_when(
    
  ))
  filter(delay_status == 1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(DEPARTURE_DELAY)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~AIRLINE)
  
  
delay_by_airline %>% 
  ggplot(aes(AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

15-30 minutes 30 minutes to 1 hour 1 to 2 hour 2+

```{r}
p <- delay_by_airline 
 # filter()

ggplot(p,aes(DEPARTURE_DELAY)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count / sum(count)))) +
  facet_wrap(~MONTH)
  
```

```{r}
flights_bwi %>% 
  ggplot(aes(DEPARTURE_DELAY)) +
  geom_histogram()

flights_bwi %>% 
  select(DEPARTURE_DELAY) %>% 
  max(na.rm=T) / 60
```

By times of year - each month and then certain periods including thanksgiving and Christmas
